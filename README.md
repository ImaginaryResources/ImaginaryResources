# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working a lot on my proxmox server which is a lot of fun. There's always something new to do, try, or learn.

I am trying to find my place either in the CS or IT feild. I am very passionate about both!

I am also learning a bit of regex which is fun to do with crosswords over at https://regexcrossword.com/profile/79061
